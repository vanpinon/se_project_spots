# Project 3: Spots

## Description

Spots is an interactive social media website. People who use this website can add and remove photos, as well as adjust their profile. This website was made using Figma design.

The webpage uses responsive design, display:grid, and media queries to set the webpage's apperance based on screen width.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
